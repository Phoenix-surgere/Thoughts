# hello-world
Hello there, I am an Econ graduate who would like to move into AI Research, even if that sounds / seems / smells improbable and untenable and unfeasible. But what can you do, right? Got to at least try.

IDEAS I WANT TO TRY OUT / EDUCATE MYSELF (MORE) IN :

1) Quantum Machine Learning (Why not?)
2) Reinforcement Learning (It could very well be the future)
3) Behavioral Psychology (and figure out how to use it for insights to build better models?)
4) Genetic Optimization and Algorithms (and really any relevant natural processes to copy when attempting to improve models)
5) Semi/Un - Supervised Learning (eg autoencoders or various dimension reduction techniques)
6) GANs (data generation seems very important for many other models)
7) Languages: SQL (for databases, which I should also figure out how to use within python); R (for extra capabilities and versatility); Later potentially C++ (which would also be geared for the hobby of game development as well!)
