# hello-world

IDEAS I WANT TO TRY OUT / EDUCATE MYSELF (MORE) IN :

1) Quantum Machine Learning (should i do quantum learning from physics first? It went badly without it the first time!)
2) Reinforcement Learning (also deeplearning.ai new TF specialization!)
3) Behavioral Psychology (and figure out how to use it for insights to build better models?)
4) Genetic Optimization and Algorithms (and really any relevant natural processes to copy when attempting to improve models)
5) Semi/Un - Supervised Learning (eg autoencoders or various dimension reduction techniques)
6) GANs (data generation seems very important for many other models) + Variatiomal Autoencoders
7) Languages: SQL (for databases, which I should also figure out how to use within python); R (UPDATE: MAKING GOOD PROGRESS ON IT! for extra capabilities and versatility); Later potentially C++ (which would also be geared for the hobby of game development as well!)
8) Future course topics I want to follow, barring ML: BioInformatics, Physics ( QM for QML and Astronomy for curiosity), Cybersecurity, Game Development (hobbyist) , Dinosaurs + Ancient History  + Creative Writing (has excellent courses on coursera!) (hobbyist) + Virology 
9) Domain Specific Applications: NLP, CV, Recommenders
10) Functional Keras API
11) Proper way to do cross-validation (eg inside folds of cv, using pipelines), nested c-v exercise and bootstrapping / MC
12) Self-Supervised learning -> Still experimental? Can only find academic papers related to it
13) (Probabilistic) Graphical Models seem interesting too, but hard
14) Model explainability! (Shap, Lime, Eli5, PDPbox)
15)VR=> Apps in ganes, googlemaps? -> Been done already via Oculus rift
16) Simulating ecosystems etc in Unreal / Unity
